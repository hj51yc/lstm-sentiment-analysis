# rnn_sentiment
This project is a pure LSTM demo using just python without the third nueral network!
It's just used for studing the LSTM, so maybe not so efficiency.

If you have any question about the project, please contact hj51yc@gmail.com .

# usage
1: You must firstly install the word2vec for running the train_senti.sh
2: edit the train_senti.sh, change the $WORD2VEC to your word2vec bin path
3: run: bash train_senti.sh
