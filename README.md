This project is a pure LSTM demo using just python without the third nueral network! <br>
It's just used for studing the LSTM, so maybe not so efficiency.<br>

1: You must firstly install the word2vec for running the train_senti.sh <br>
2: edit the train_senti.sh, change the $WORD2VEC to your word2vec bin path <br>
3: then just run: bash train_senti.sh <br>
